I just entered Geo Crack to the CoderCharts Win 8 [Hackathon](http://codercharts.com/hackathon/windows-8-online-app-a-thon/team/neiti). If you havenâ€™t already please vote for it!

Single Player game play is pretty much finished and I added a lot of content since the last post. Depending on feedback and time constraints I might add Hot Seat and Multi Player game modes.

Check out the game trailer:

The Windows Store is unfortunately still not open to submissions from individual developers. I plan on releasing a free version of Geo Crack (possibly with some ads) once it is.
