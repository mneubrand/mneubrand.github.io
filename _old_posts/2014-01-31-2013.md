2013 was a busy year. I started working in the game industry professionally and learned a lot. Unfortunately though I fell off the onegameamonth bandwagon in February already. New year, new resolutions. Lets see how far I can make it this time :)

Just published my January game as entry to [#candyjam](http://itch.io/jam/candyjam): [Candy King â€“ Cease and Desist Saga](http://neiti.itch.io/candy-king---cease-and-desist-saga)
