Lots of things happened in the last months under which most of my pet projects here suffered. I finally finished my Master’s and graduated and just started a new job. I am excited that I could turn a hobby into a full-time job and started working at [GREE](http://gree-corp.com/) as Android game developer.

I wanted to make it a new year’s resolution to create one game prototype per month in 2013 anyways so the [#onegameamonth](http://www.onegameamonth.com/) project by McFunkypants was perfect to join for that. Hope that the rewards section there is going to add some extra motivation. For January I am working on finishing the Marmalade based BB10 game I started a while ago. Deadline is Jan 19th so I hopefully get this done soon.
