mat(c)h is still waiting for review on the BlackBerry Appworld (for over 3 weeks nowâ€¦). In the meanwhile I decided to open source it on github: [https://github.com/mneubrand/mat-c-h](https://github.com/mneubrand/mat-c-h). The repo contains all artwork and the JavaScript and Lua/Marmalade Quick version of mat(c)h. I am very happy with the visual outcome but the gameplay and game mechanics are lacking a lot. Balance is also horrible mainly due to rushing it in the end without proper play testing. Maybe someone can salvage parts of it for something useful.
