js13kGames ended a while ago and bomb.js unfortunately didn’t make it into the top 10. In the end a total of 61 games were entered and a lot of high quality entries were amongst them. At least my as3fxr synth port got a shout out at the [presentation](http://end3r.com/slides/ogs12-js13kgames/#slide15) at onGameStart.

Between js13kGames, job and finishing the first draft of my thesis I had not enough time to participate in the last Ludum Dare 24. To make up for it I am going to participate in the currently ongoing Ludum Dare October Challenge. The premise is simple: Make a game — Take it to Market — Earn $1. To finish the challenge I am going to release an ad-supported version of Geo Crack on the Windows 8 Store (currently in certification) and hope that it at least makes a few bucks.

On the October Challenge resource page there is also an opportunity listed to get a [free BlackBerry Playbook](http://www.madewithmarmalade.com/blackberry) by releasing an app built with the Marmalade SDK on the BlackBerry Appworld. If time permits it I might give this a shot as well.
