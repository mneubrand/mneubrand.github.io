I just finished porting mat(c)h from Lua/Marmalade SDK to JavaScript/HTML5. Here is a gameplay video of the JavaScript port:

Instead of plain HTML5 Canvas I decided to try out one of the many available [JavaScript game engines](https://github.com/bebraw/jswiki/wiki/Game-Engines). I wanted something lightweight and ended up using [sprite.js](https://github.com/batiste/sprite.js/). Though it did get the job done in the end, it was a painful journey and I will look into a more feature-rich engine next time or maybe even shell out the $99 to get ImpactJS.

I also integrated [clay.io](http://clay.io/) leaderboards and published it on the clay.io platform. I first heard about them when they sponsored [js13kgames](http://js13kgames.com/) and using their platform has been an awesome experience so far. Integration is very easy, the often claimed 1-line integration really applies in this case, and uploading it was straight-forward as well. I’ll definitely publish more #[1GAM](http://onegameamonth.com/) entries there. mat(c)h got pushed to Facebook as well as clay.io makes Facebook integration a breeze. Depending on how Facebook/clay.io/BlackBerry Appworld go I might publish it to other platforms as well.

For my already delayed February #1GAM I’m currently working on a [Java4K](http://www.java4k.com/) entry. I hope the size restrictions will let me finish this one relatively fast. At the moment I am playing around with an artillery game prototype.
