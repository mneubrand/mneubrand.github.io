Ludum Dare 23 is over and already well into the rating period. The theme of the competition was "Tiny World". I submitted a simple sidescroller/endless runner game where a white blood-cell (Luke O’Cyte) chases an E. coli bacteria (Al Coli). You can find my submission "Bacterial World" [here](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=11653). This was the first time I completely created a game from scratch: code, sounds, music and graphics. All of that in under 48h!

As the game mechanics are very similar to the little pot fall game I made for #GPCv12 I learned from some of the mistakes I made in it. So Bacterial World has a lot more features and polish than Pot Fall. Much more sophisticated collision detection (only working in Chrome though), more animations, much more polished game play (Al Coli running in front of you, sliding/jumping instead of just left/right). The code is also cleaner and uses only one main game loop with update/render phase instead of having a lot of random window.setTimeouts floating around.

So far the comments I received were all really encouraging. My goal was to make it in the ranking into the upper half (there were an insane 1071 submissions to the 48h competition so Top 500 would be nice). Rating period is still going for 19 days so I keep my fingers crossed.
