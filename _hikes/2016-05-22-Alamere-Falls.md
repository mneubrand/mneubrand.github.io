Some friends of us suggested that we should do this hike together. I've never heard of it before but it turned out to be a great recommendation. Alamere Falls is a waterfall near Bolinas that
flows directly into the Pacific Ocean. The entire hike is a little over 4 miles one way without a lot of elevation change and the falls at the end of it are spectacular. At least they
are this year thanks to a decent rain season.

Our friends had a car so we didn't have to worry about transportation this time. The parking lot is very small and was already full. Park rangers were intercepting cars before they could reach
the parking lot and directing people to park on the side of the road. This is a great way to prevent the traffic chaos that would otherwise happen if people realize that the lot is full and have
to turn around on the narrow road leading to the parking lot. There are some restrooms at the parking lot however there is no water.

The first few miles are following the coast line and offer nice ocean views. After that the trail turns inland and passes two little lakes: Bass Lake and Pelican Lake.

The intersection with the trail to Alamere Falls can be missed easily. The sign for it is covered in graffiti and stickers and seems to just point into thick brush. It also warns you that the
trail is unmaintained. It didn't turn out to be a problem in the end. We just had to hunch over a couple of times. Our entire group wore long pants which probably helped as well. If you don't
want to make your way through the brush you can follow the trail a mile further and then track back on the beach to reach Alamere Falls.

At the end of the trail there is a steep section that takes you to a few small waterfalls. After that another small climb takes you down to the beach were Alamere Falls flows directly into the
ocean.

The hike only took us a couple of hours and we ended our day at nearby Lagunitas Brewing Company in Petaluma with some great burgers.

Day total: 8.37 miles and 1475 ft climb
