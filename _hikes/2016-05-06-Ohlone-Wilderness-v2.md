We already did the [Ohlone Wilderness Trail thru-hike in 2015]({{site.url}}/hiking/Ohlone-Wilderness-Thru-Hike) and it was a great experience so we decided to repeat it in May 2016.
Thanks to a better rainy season and 20 degree lower temperatures this was supposed to go much smoother than last time. But things didn't work out that way.

# Preparation

Since last year we invested in some extra equipment like proper hiking cloth and shoes and a Jetboil Zip Cooking System.

# Transportation

We took a similar route as last year. BART to Dublin followed by a bus to Livermore. Afterwards we had dinner in Livermore and again took an Uber to Del Valle. This time around we ended
up with a nicer spot and ended our night at Del Valle with a couple of beers.

# Day 1

The weather forecast predicted some rain but we lucked out and stayed mostly dry. Just a little mugginess. Because we finished day 1 very early last year we decided to start fairly late and
only reached the Ohlone Trail sign-in panel around 9.

After years of drought the rainy season made a huge difference in the surrounding vegetation. Hills that were golden and dry last year were lush and green this time around.
Look at this picture of a section in 2015 on the left vs. 2016 on the right.

We took the same route as last time but skipped Rose Peak and headed to Maggie's Half Acre directly instead. Because of the weather conditions we didn't even have to filter water at the campground
this time but had plenty left. Thanks to our new Jetboil dinner was much better this time as well. Nothing beats a warm meal after a day of hiking even if it is a freeze dried Mountain House meal.

# Day 2

The first few miles on the way to Sunol were very enjoyable while hiking through the misty East Bay hills. Unfortunately my ankles started to hurt quite a bit after that. The new hiking shoes were
not working out at all and bruised my ankles. Luckily I was able to return them afterwards (thanks REI) and now have a pair that seems much better.

We had lunch at Sunol and then continued on towards mission peak. At this point my ankles were in a lot of pain and I had trouble dragging myself along. At least this time we managed to not take
a wrong turn when we entered Mission Peak Park because we knew what to look out for. At this point Megan was still in good shape but it took me a long time to make it down Mission Peak. Being
surrounded by a lot of day hikers

We took an Uber back to the Fremont BART station and BART back to the city. This was the first big hike for us this season. I hope I'll fair better next time.

Day total: 16.94 miles and 2328 ft climb
