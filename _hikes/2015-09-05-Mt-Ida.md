We spent Labor Day weekend in Rocky Mountain National Park. After we spent Saturday driving through the park and doing a short hike to acclimate to the altitude we decided to
hike Mount Ida on Sunday. The Rangers warned us about potential thunderstorms in the afternoon, so we got up early and reached the trailhead at Milner Pass around 7am. Starting
that early also meant that we could enjoy spectacular views of the sunrise on the drive to the trailhead and saw elk enjoying their breakfast really close to the road.

There is no sign for Mount Ida directly at the parking lot for the trailhead, so we weren't sure if we were on the right path until we saw a sign a few hundred feet into the trail.
The first mile is below the treeline and not exposed until you reach a fork with a warning sign for Mount Ida. The warning tells you that it is still 3.5 miles to  Mount Ida and
that "Several hikers have been lost in an attempt to return from Mount Ida to their starting point. **Don't be one of them.**". Not exactly a confidence booster, but we still thought
we could make it.

Shortly after the fork the trail begins to climb above the tree line. With wind speeds from 8 to 15mph and gusts of up to 40mph, it got cold quickly. The rest of the way was exposed
alpine tundra.

Once above the tree line the trail is still well maintained and easy to follow until you reach the last climb to the peak of Mount Ida. At this point the trail stops and you have to
make your way through a boulder field. The boulder field was also swarming with Pika, little mammals that only live at high altitudes and make high-pitched sounds to warn each other from
approaching predators and hikers. It was fun to watch them scramble and eye us suspiciously once they reached a safe distance.

Because it was pretty cloudy we thought we reached the top multiple times just to find another ascent waiting, bu the views from the top made it all worth it in the end.

We were pretty cold at this point, I had trouble taking photos on my phone because my fingers were too cold, and were looking forward to getting out of the wind. On the way down the weather
got slightly better and some parts of the trail were warmed by sunshine.

We reached the trailhead around 12:30pm. The whole hike took roughly 3 hours up and 2 hours down with a 30 minute break on top.
