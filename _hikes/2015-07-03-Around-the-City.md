Inspired by an article in sfist ["How To Take A 7x7x7x7-Mile Walking Tour Of San Francisco"](http://sfist.com/2015/06/08/how_to_take_a_7x7x7x7-mile_walking.php) we decided to give
this hike a shot. We haven't done any longer hikes in quite a while but we figured it was a mostly flat route so it should be fine.

We started early at 6:40 AM from Ocean Beach and went in a counter-clockwise direction.

The first 10 miles went by quickly and we were going at a good pace. It also helped that the Western part of the city was covered in fog, which kept the temperature down.
We were optimistic when we rounded the second corner of the city in the Bay View and headed around Candlestick Park. Only one big staircase of the old stadium was still remaining.
The rest was already torn down.

Things began to drag shortly after that when we rounded Hunter's point. We slowed down quite a bit and walking up 3rd Ave to AT&T park felt like it would never end.
Lunch couldn't come at a better time and we stopped a little after AT&T park on the Embarcadero. We didn't waste too much time because we were worried we would not get
up again otherwise. Next planned break was Crissy Field.

Fisherman's Wharf was my least favorite portion of the entire hike. Trying to navigate around tourist when you've already 20 miles in your legs was an exercise in frustration.
At least the anger made us increase our speed for a while.

This was followed by the Marina Green and Crissy Field. Just a few miles but it felt like ten especially because we were walking (more hobbling at that point to be honest) against the wind.
Finally we made it to the Warming Hut Cafe on the other side of Crissy Field and refilled our energy with some Gatorade and some energy bars. We almost wanted to give up at this point
but our goal was so close that we carried on and dragged ourselves up to the Golden Gate Bridge.

At this point my phone battery was almost dead so unfortunately I had to stop recording our route. Through the Presidio and Lands End we had to deal with a bunch of elevation change.
Interestingly the uphill parts felt like a relief at this point but downhill was brutal on the knees. One last descend down from the Cliff House and we were on our home stretch down
Ocean Beach.

32 miles. By far the longest hike we've ever done!
