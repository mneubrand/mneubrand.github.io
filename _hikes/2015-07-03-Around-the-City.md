Inspired by an article in sfist ["How To Take A 7x7x7x7-Mile Walking Tour Of San Francisco"](http://sfist.com/2015/06/08/how_to_take_a_7x7x7x7-mile_walking.php) my wife and I decided to give
this hike a shot. We hadn't done any longer hikes in quite a while, but we figured it was mostly a flat route, so it shouldn't be too difficult.

We started early at 6:40am from Ocean Beach and went in a counter-clockwise direction.

The first 10 miles went by quickly and we were walking at a good pace. It also helped that the western part of the city was covered in fog, which kept the temperature down.
We were optimistic when we rounded the second corner of the city in the Bayview District and headed around Candlestick Park. Only one big staircase of the old stadium was still remaining--the
rest had already been torn down.

Things began to drag shortly after that when we rounded Hunters Point neighborhood. We slowed down quite a bit--walking up 3rd Avenue towards AT&T Park felt like it would never end.
Lunch couldn't have come at a better time, so we stopped a little after AT&T Park on the Embarcadero. We didn't waste too much time because we were worried we would not get
up again. The next planned break was Crissy Field.

Fisherman's Wharf was my least favorite portion of the entire hike. Trying to navigate around tourists when you're feeling the 20 miles in your legs was an exercise in patience.
At least the frustration made us increase our speed for a while.

This was followed by the Marina Green and Crissy Field. Although both only cover a few miles, it felt like many more especially because we were walking (more hobbling at that point to be honest) against the wind.
Finally we made it to the Warming Hut Cafe at the end of Crissy Field and refilled our energy with some Gatorade and energy bars. We felt like givng up at this point,
but our goal was so close that we carried on and dragged ourselves up to the Golden Gate Bridge.

By now my phone battery was almost dead, so unfortunately I had to stop recording our route. Through the Presidio and Lands End we had to deal with a lot of elevation change.
Interestingly, the uphill parts felt like a relief, but downhill was brutal on the knees. One last descent after the Cliff House and we were on the home stretch to
Ocean Beach.

32 miles. By far the longest hike we've ever done!
