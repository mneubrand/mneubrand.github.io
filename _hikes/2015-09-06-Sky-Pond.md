For our second hike in Rocky Mountain National Park we decided to hike to Sky Pond. The weather forecast was predicting rain and we wanted something below the tree line. We'd also have to
catch a flight home later that day, so we didn't have a lot of time. Sky Pond with around 8 miles total ticked all our boxes.

We started around 8am on the Glacier Gorge trailhead. Unfortunately, the parking lot there was full so we had to drive to Bear Lake and take the shuttle bus back to the trailhead.
Shortly after we started it began to drizzle. Alberta Falls is just a little over half a mile into the trail and a beautiful spot. This early in the morning it was still pretty quiet
as well. On our way down it was swarmed with people.

From Alberta Falls to the Loch takes roughly another 1.5 miles. We saw a lot of people with fishing gear on the way up there, so it must be a good destination for fishing.
The view over the lake is beautiful and you can already see the waterfall coming down from Sky Pond in the distance.

Another 1.5 miles and we reached the bottom of the climb to Sky Pond. Up to this point the whole hike has been very easy with good trails and not a lot of elevation gain, but the trail to Sky Pond ends before you reach it and you have to climb the last 100 feet. 
At first we were not sure if we want to risk climbing because the rocks were
still wet from rain, but when we saw people come down from Sky Pond we gave it a shot as well. The first section is by far the hardest however, we took our time and it
turned out to not be a problem.

Sky Pond was beautiful, but unfortunately the wind was really strong. You can even see the waves caused by the wind a little bit in the picture.

We were glad we got an early start because many more people were on the trail on the way down. Rocky Mountain National Park is amazing and we definitely want to come back.
Maybe next time we'll be in a good enough shape to pull off Longs Peak.

Day total: 7.74 miles and 1910 ft climb
