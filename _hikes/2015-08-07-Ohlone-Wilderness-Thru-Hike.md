We've never really considered doing a long distance hike or thru-hike before but got turned on to the idea after watching the documentary [Mile.. Mile and a Half](https://www.amazon.com/Mile-Half-Jason-Fitzpatrick/dp/B00FJVD4AS/ref=pd_ys_iyr4)
about a group of people hiking the John Muir Trail. It seemed like an incredible experience and something we wanted to try as well. Starting with a 3 week long thru-hike was probably a bad idea
so I started looking for some short thru-hikes in the bay area and found the [Ohlone Wilderness Trail](http://www.ebparks.org/parks/ohlone). Coincidentally we already had a camping weekend in Del
Valle, one of the two starting points of the trail, lined up.

All we had to do was move the 2nd day from Del Valle to Maggie's Half Acre, a backpacking campground in the Ohlone Wilderness. I had to call the EB Parks office to change our reservation and
they were really helpful in rearranging our trip.

# Preparation

We've done car camping plenty of times before so we had a lot of the necessary equipment already. My wife also had a Jansport Klamath 2 85l backpack from backpacking in Asia we'd use as the
main backpack. I'd carry it while my wife would carry some additional water and extra cloth in my work backpack.

We were only missing a few items:

* Sleeping bags/pads: When car camping we sleep on a huge air mattress with normal blankets/pillows so we bought 2 [REI Radiant Down Sleeping Bags](http://www.rei.com/product/862474/rei-radiant-sleeping-bag)
and [Therm-a-Rest RidgeRest Sleeping Pads](http://www.amazon.com/Therm-a-Rest-RidgeRest-SOLite-Sleeping-Pad/dp/B004534DB0).
* Water filter: There would be no treated water available at Maggie's Half Acre so I bought a [Sawyer Mini Water Filter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TOX6UM6?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00)
* Flashlights: The flashlights and lantern we own were huge and heavy so we bought some [cheap](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039PV1QK?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00)
smaller [ones](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SR20JLS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00)
* Food: Usually we bring a huge cooler and camping grill and make sandwiches for lunch and BBQ for dinner. Not really an option for a thru-hike. So we stocked up on protein bars, dried prunes,
almonds and turkey jerky with some thin whole wheat buns from Trader Joe's. For our first ever thru-hike we didn't want to buy a small portable stove and try to cook hot meals.
* Water: We planned on carrying a total of 6l for the two of us and bought a bunch of 1.5l bottles at Trader Joe's

Things we already had:

* [Wenzel Ridgeline 3 Tent](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PB2HBW?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00): Heavy but I didn't want to buy another tent.
* Clothing: We only packed very few cloth and no jackets as the weather would be really hot.
* Miscellaneous items: First Aid Kit, sunscreen, insect repellent, books, battery phone charger

Unfortunately I didn't weigh the backpacks before we left but they sure felt significantly heavier than anything I've ever carried on a day hike.

# Transportation

We don't own a car and the hike is not a loop so even if we rented one we'd have to somehow get back to the start to pick up the car after finishing the hike so we went with public transportation
instead. The planned route: [BART to Fremont, 99 Bus to the ACE station, ACE to Livermore](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Embarcadero+BART,+298+Market+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94111/Livermore,+CA/@37.6868977,-122.2297509,11z/am=t/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x80858063e4026c91:0xb3aede0b9c48b1e3!2m2!1d-122.3957955!2d37.7935881!1m5!1m1!1s0x808fe586385a2071:0x98d32231cb6bd871!2m2!1d-121.7680088!2d37.6818745!5i2)
, Uber to Del Valle. We left work a little early on Friday to beat the rush hour commute and things went really smoothly. It took us 2 hours to get to Livermore but we never had to wait for
a connection for more than 10 minutes.

In Livermore we ate dinner at the First Street AleHouse and then took an Uber to Del Valle (tipped the guy extra for driving us out to the middle of nowhere). We opted to get dropped off at the
park entrance and hiked the last 2 miles to the campground to get a better feel for hiking with the big backpack. Total transportation cost/person: $24.86 ($5.95 BART, $2.10 AC Transit Bus, $5.25 ACE
Train, $11.56 Uber)

When we checked in at the campground we also purchased our Ohlone Trail Permits (required) for $2 each. The permits also contain a map of the entire trail so they're well worth that. Most people
at the campground were families car camping so we felt a little out of place and called it a night early.

# Day 1

We woke up early and left the Del Valle campground around 7.30am. From there we took the Vallecito Trail that joins up with the Ohlone Trail at the Ohlone Trail sign-in panel.

*Trail Head*

The trail starts off with a long, steep and strenuous climb but we were excited about the adventure ahead. When we reached the sign-in panel I made the mistake to take a look at
the map and see how far we've gotten. Only at 1190 feet elevation and 1 mile into the official trail. Ouch.

Over the next mile we slowly and painfully climbed a little over 1000 feet to Boyd's camp. The big pack really started to wear me down and I had to start taking small breaks to catch my breath.

From Boyd's camp the next mile went downhill a little bit until we reached the beginning of a section that's called "Big Burn" on the map. They were not kidding. Big Burn is by far the toughest
part of the entire hike with over a 1000 feet elevation gain and some really steep sections. We went through a lot of water and I was really glad when we reached Schlieper Rock at the end.

From that point on things flattened out and our pace and mood picked up again. Roughly 5 more miles to go until Rose Peak.

Before hiking up to Rose Peak there is one more section going downhill to North Fork Indian Creek. At this point every step I took downhill just made me angry, knowing that I'd have to go uphill
on the other side of the creek to reach Rose Peak. But that anger gave me enough energy to make it to Rose Peak and resist the urge to skip it and go to Maggie's Half Acre directly (there are 2 access
roads to Maggie's half acre, one before and one after Rose Peak). When we finally reached the peak it felt amazing.

From the peak it's only half a mile or so to Maggie's Half Acre campground and we arrived there shortly after 1pm. There was a tap with untreated water and we refilled our water bottles through our filter. I've never been so glad to
have water before. I didn't even put up our tent but just unrolled one of our sleeping pads and took a long nap.

Later in the afternoon we put up our tent and relaxed and read. Dinner was a bit of a letdown because I forgot to pack condiments and the buns we brought were mouldy so we had almonds and turkey
jerky.

Megan wanted to watch the sunset outside our tent and see the stars but I was so exhausted that I passed out before that.

Day total: 9.7 miles and 3493 ft climb

# Day 2

We woke up around 5.50am and broke camp by 6.30am. The sunrise over the hills was beautiful and we were still high up enough to be above the marine layer. The first few miles were pretty
flat and we made good progress. It also helped that we carried only 3l of water because there would be plenty of spots we can refill at available during the day.

*Sunrise over the East Bay hills*

The hike to Sunol went through beautiful landscapes and we encountered a bunch of wildlife: grazing cattle, rabbits, hawks, chipmunks and even a tarantula. We knew there was a visitor center
there as well so we were hopeful that we could buy some food to make up for the disappointing dinner the night before.

![Chipmunk checking us out]({{ site.url }}/img/hikes/ohlone/12.jpg)

We reached Sunol shortly after 11am and refilled our water bottles. Unfortunately the Sunol visitor center only sells snacks and ice cream was sold out. We got two clif bars and ate some more
dried prunes and almonds before starting the hike up Mission Peak.

The first miles after Sunol go through land owned by the S.F. Water District on a gravel road. We were ascending at a nice, even pace (very different than Big Burn the previous day) and
finally saw our goal, Mission Peak, in the distance.

Up until that point direction signs have been great the entire trail. But when we reached Mission Peak Park we must've taken a wrong turn and accidentally ended up on Mill Creek Road. We really
didn't want to try and backtrack at this point so we decided to carry on and use the Peak Trail from Mill Creek Road to get back on to the Ohlone Trail. Unfortunately that also meant 500 ft
unnecessary elevation gain before we finally reached the trail again and began our descend into Fremont.

![Mission Peak towards Fremont]({{ site.url }}/img/hikes/ohlone/13.jpg)
*Mission Peak towards Fremont*

Our legs were pretty much shot at that point so the descend took longer than it should have and was painful at times. All worth it in the end when we finished our first thru-hike!

![Finish]({{ site.url }}/img/hikes/ohlone/14.jpg)
*Finish*

We took an Uber back to the Fremont BART station and BART back to the city. My apologies to the people sitting near us. I'm sure we didn't smell pleasant at that point.

Day total: 17.65 miles and 2447 ft climb
