Though we spent most of our time on Maui at the beach and drinking Lava Flows we did manage to get one hike in. The Waihee Ridge Trail is a short 4 mile roundtrip hike
on Maui's north shore with amazing views along the way.

We almost missed the exit from Kahekili Highway to get to the trailhead. There don't seem to be any signs but we figured it out thanks to Google Maps.

From the parking lot the entire hike is around 4 miles roundtrip with a moderate 1500 ft elevation climb. First half up, second half down. The views along
the way were great despite some low clouds around the mountain tops.

It was a nice little hike that only took 2.5 hours and a good change of scenery from hanging out at the beach all day. A bit of exercise also made us feel less guilty
about all the Lava Flows :)

Day total: 3.92 miles and 1553 ft climb
