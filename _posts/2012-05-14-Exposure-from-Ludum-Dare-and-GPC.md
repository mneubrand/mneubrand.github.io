title: Exposure from Ludum Dare and GPC

I recently participated in two game jams, Ludum Dare 23 and Game Prototype Challenge v12, with web-based entries. Out of curiosity I hooked up both entries to Google Analytics to measure the kind of exposure one can get from those jams. Here are the results:

###GPCv12 ([Pot Fall](projects/pot-fall/index.html)):

GPCv12 only led to 19 referrals to my entry of which 16 were unique page views according to Google Analytics. As I only participated in #GPCv12 as preparation to #LD48 and my entry was pretty mediocre this isn’t too bad. I don’t think I’ll be participating in any future GPCs but maybe shift to a new jam like Experimental Gameplay Project instead. Another issue with GPC is that it has no built in possibility for getting feedback which is my main reason to participate in a game jam. So the only feedback I got was one comment from a blog post.

###LD48 ([Bacterial World](projects/bacterial-world/index.html)):

The Ludum Dare entry got significantly more exposure than the GPC one. In ~3 weeks it had 250 referrals of which 189 were unique page views. Even more importantly it got 36 comments on the Ludum Dare page and most of them were very encouraging. I’ll be definitely participating again in the next Ludum Dare and look forward to it already.

Unfortunately I am going to have to take a break from game jams for a while now and focus on my thesis and some other work I postponed for quite a while now. I am also preparing a little entry for the [Evernote Devcup](http://devcup.evernote.com/). Fingers crossed, because 10k would really come in handy right now.
