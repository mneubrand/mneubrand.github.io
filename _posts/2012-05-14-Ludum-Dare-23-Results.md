The voting period is over and I just checked out the results for [Bacterial World](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-23/?action=preview&uid=11653):

| Rank | Category | Rating |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| #135 | Humor | 3.00 |
| #297 | Fun | 3.06 |
| #320 | Audio | 2.74 |
| #363 | Mood | 2.77 |
| #419 | Theme | 3.06 |
| #438 | Graphics | 2.87 |
| #452 | Overall | 2.92 |
| #813 | Innovation | 2.02 |

For my first #LD48 reaching the top half (top 500 in case of this LD) was the goal and asides in the innovation category Bacterial World made it to the top half in every other category. Innovation was sacrificed to make sure I will finish a complete game for my first participation. All in all I am pretty happy with the results. I am going to shift focus for the next jam and will try to focus on innovation first and aim for the top quarter. Now off to play all the winners :)
