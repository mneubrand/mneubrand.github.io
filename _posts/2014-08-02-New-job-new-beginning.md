I recently left my position at GREE and joined Salesforce.com. Becoming a professional game developer was fulfilling a lifelong dream
but after a while I had to realize that it is not the right career choice for me. Now that I'm not doing game development on a daily
basis at my job anymore I hope I'll be more motivated to finish some hobby projects and participate in some game jams to scratch that
\#gamedev itch. I'm currently playing around with a prototype for [GBJam 3](http://jams.gamejolt.io/gbjam3).
