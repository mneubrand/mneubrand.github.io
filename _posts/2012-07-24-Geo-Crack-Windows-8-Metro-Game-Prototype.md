title: Geo Crack - Windows 8 Metro Game Prototype

I recently got around to download the Windows 8 Release Preview and play around with the new Metro UI. While I don’t really like the idea of using it on a laptop or desktop I think it has great potential in the tablet market. At least the Surface prototype Microsoft showed looks pretty promising to me. I really like the clean look and feel of the Metro UI and started playing around with Metro app development (using C#/XAML).

After a while I came up with an idea for a little Geography quiz game and started prototyping it. The game is very simple and just an excuse to explore Windows 8 development. I think the templates MS provides make it real easy for artistically challenged developers (a.k.a me) to create visually appealing apps. Here are some screenshots  showing the first progress:

Progress so far was smooth and C#/XAML was very easy to pick up. I’m running Windows 8 inside VMWare Player so performance is terrible. Coming from Eclipse or command line development, VisualStudio needs some getting used to as well. The all-caps menu feels like it’s constantly yelling at you and the fact that I can’t make changes to a project (e.g. change code or copy a new asset into it) while the app is running is a major pain. I can live without hotswap but at least let me make changes in between starts!

I originally didn’t plan on finishing it but as development so far was quite fun I plan on it now. There’s a lot of other side projects going on right now but my goal is to finish up a first version and release it on the Windows Store once it is open for all developers. Not sure yet if it’s gonna just be a free app or I am going with ad-supported.
