Lots of exciting things happening at the moment. After a seemingly endless amount of time I finally finished and successfully defended my thesis! I am also going to switch jobs (currently in the final offer stages with 2 companies) soon and take a 1 month trip to India between jobs. Very excited for all of that!

Because of all of the above there was not a lot of time for side projects in the last months. I started submitting "Geo Crack" to the Windows 8 Store but so far it failed certification multiple times. It is quite annoying that MS doesn’t give you a complete list of issues from the start but instead add one minor issue each time it failed certification. Turnaround time on a submission is ~5 days which makes these iterations quite painful. On top of that the Win8 trial version I used to create Geo Crack just expired so I am going to have to get a license and resubmit once more. Hopefully I can get this done fairly soon.

While I initially planned on submitting Geo Crack and working on a BlackBerry app (to qualify for a free BlackBerry Playbook in [this](http://www.madewithmarmalade.com/blackberry) offer from Marmalade) for Ludum Dare’s October Challenge, none of that got done on time. But things are picking up now. Below you can find a preview to a number puzzle game I am working on for the BlackBerry Playbook:

I hope to get a first beta version of it done this weekend and submit a version to the BlackBerry AppWorld before the India trip.
