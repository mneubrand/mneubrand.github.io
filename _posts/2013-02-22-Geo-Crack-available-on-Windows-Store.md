For my February #1GAM I finally finished Geo Crack. I originally wrote it as an entry to a Windows 8 Hackathon and it actually [won](http://codercharts.com/blog/windows-8-online-app-a-thon-we-have-winners) the Edutainment category. Finally I got around to polish and publish it and it has just been released on the Windows Store [here](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-US/app/geo-crack/dec4feaa-e6c1-4598-91de-4f09f4173187).

You can see the gameplay in the video below:
