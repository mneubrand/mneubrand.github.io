[\#LOWREZJAM](http://jams.gamejolt.io/lowrezjam2014), a month long jam to create games with a maximum resolution of 32x32 pixel, just finished. What some people
managed to cram into this resolution is amazing. [Land of Lorez](http://gamejolt.com/games/rpg/lands-of-lorez/27439/) by
[@photonstorm](https://twitter.com/photonstorm) is my favorite entry so far. A complete 3d dungeon crawler in 32x32 pixels!

I found the idea intriguing so I worked on a small entry myself: Survival, a 2d survival horror platformer.

The controls are a little wonky. But I'm happy with the graphics and atmosphere of the game, especially the graphic noise overlay.
