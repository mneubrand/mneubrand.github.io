The last Ludum Dare I participated in was Ludum Dare 23 back in April 2012. Since then I've always found some excuse to not participate. But for Ludum Dare 29
I finally pulled through and participated again. You can play my entry, "Drill Baby Drill", [here](projects/drill-baby-drill/index.html) and find the source on
[GitHub](https://github.com/mneubrand/drill-baby-drill).

The theme this time was "Beneath the Surface" and after discarding some overly ambitious ideas I settled on a game about drilling to oil reserves.
It has some similarity with snake (can't drill through your own path) but I put a twist on it. Different materials effect the speed of the drill which
makes, at least in my opinion :), for quite interesting gameplay. Because the mechanics were quite simple I got some basic movement code done Friday evening
and was basically feature complete just ~18 hours into the competition. This turned out to be a blessing because other appointments that weekend severely
limited my dev time after that point anyways. From that point on I just focused on game balancing, level design and visuals then I had last time.

My drawing skills are still terrible so I picked an art style that would hide this fact as much as possible that was inspired by infographics. The outcome looked
surprisingly decent. Though the entire game is pretty short (you can probably finish it within 5 minutes), I think the level design is one of the parts that turned
out really great and I got a lot of positive feedback about the nice ramp up in difficulty and step-by-step introduction of gameplay elements. The worst part of the
game is the crappy Audio. I used as3sfxr to generate some audio effects but the 8-bit style of the sound effects doesn't work with the graphic style at all and there
is no background music or anything.

When the deadline approached I was pretty down on myself because I turned another #LD48 into a #LD24 and the game didn't live up to the vision I had in mind when
I started it. But it was in a playable state and I didn't want to flake so I submitted it anyways.

Early feedback was surprisingly good and people seemed to really enjoy playing the game so my outlook started to become more positive. This week the results finally
arrived:

| Rank | Category | Rating |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| #70  | Theme | 3.92 |
| #140 | Overall | 3.70 |
| #150 | Fun | 3.59 |
| #163 | Innovation | 3.69 |
| #269 | Graphics | 3.63 |
| #530 | Mood | 3.00 |
| #646 | Audio | 2.60 |

Drill, Baby, Drill ranked #140 Overall out of 1493 total entries! It also ranked nicely in most other categories asides Audio and Mood and is way ahead of my last entry.
I'm very happy with those results :).

Hopefully I'll manage to participate in the next Ludum Dare this August and get a little bit of a streak going. It's already marked in my calendar and I'm looking forward to it.
