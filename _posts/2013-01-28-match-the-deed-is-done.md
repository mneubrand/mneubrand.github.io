title: mat(c)h – the deed is done

I just submitted a first version of mat(c)h for the Playbook to the Blackberry App World. For a while there it looked like I’d fail already in the first month of [onegameamonth](http://onegameamonth.com/). mat(c)h is a match 3 game with a mathematical twist. Instead of matching colors, etc. one has to match a number by picking three numbers a,b,c so that a times b plus or minus c is equal to it. It’s inspired by a tabletop game I used to play as a kid.

It’s written with [Marmalade Quick](https://www.madewithmarmalade.com/content/marmalade-quick-improved-beta-version-available-now) SDK in Lua. This was my first project with the Marmalade SDK and Lua so I had a rough time getting started. Once I got used to Lua though I really started liking the language. Its simplicity is great. Though I was skeptic of the performance I’d get by using a scripting language, Lua in combination with Marmalade Quick seems to be very slick as well. Once I clean it up a bit I’ll probably publish the source code of it. I know that publishing for just the Playbook isn’t exactly getting mat(c)h in front of the largest audience in the world. I developed mat(c) for the Playbook because I signed up for a Marmalade [offer](http://www.madewithmarmalade.com/blackberry) earlier where you could get a free Playbook by building an app for it which uses the Marmalade SDK. I plan on porting it to JavaScript as well.

Below are some screenshots of it. I'll try to record a gameplay video soon as well.
