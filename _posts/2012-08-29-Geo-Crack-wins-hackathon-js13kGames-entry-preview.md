Last night the winners of the @codercharts Online app-a-thon were [announced](http://codercharts.com/blog/windows-8-online-app-a-thon-we-have-winners) and Geo Crack won the Edutainment category! Thanks to everybody who voted.

In the meanwhile an entry to another competition is nearly finished as well. I spent some time over the last weeks to work on a game for [js13kGames](http://js13kgames.com/). js13kGames have to be written in HTML5/JavaScript/CSS3 and be less than 13kb in size. My ambitions were of course too high again (node.js multiplayer, dynamically synthesized midi, etc.) and I had to downscale quite a bit. The result seems pretty playable though and just needs a little more polishing/play testing.

Here is a first screenshot of my entry bomb.js:
